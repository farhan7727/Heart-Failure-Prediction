# Heart Failure Prediction Model

This project implements a **Heart Failure Prediction Model** using **Random Forest Classifier**, **PCA**, and **Feature Scaling** to enhance prediction accuracy. The model achieves an **accuracy of 87.5%**, with **precision of 89.6%**, **recall of 88.7%**, and an **F1-score of 89.2%**, enabling early diagnosis and timely intervention.

## Features
- **Random Forest Classifier** for high predictive performance  
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction  
- **Feature Scaling (Standardization)** for improved model efficiency  
- **Handles categorical features** with one-hot encoding  
- **Predicts heart disease likelihood** based on medical attributes  

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: Heart Failure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).

## Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, PCA, StandardScaler)**
